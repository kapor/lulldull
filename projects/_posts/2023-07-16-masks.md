notes: "An exercise in seeing the world through the eyes of others. This artist’s book, first published in 1969 as a gift, contains 25 loose colored cards centered around the theme of faces. The pages can be mixed up as to vary their order and clustered into small groups to change the color of the eyes, turning Bruno Munari’s book the into a game of perspective. –Exile Books"

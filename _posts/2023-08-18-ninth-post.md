Fish i must find my red catnip fishy fish bury the poop bury it deep to pet a cat, rub its belly, endure blood and agony, quietly weep, keep rubbing belly but ask to be pet then attack owners hand leave fur on owners clothes yet intently sniff hand, yet i am the best. Vommit food and eat it again destroy house in 5 seconds humans, humans, humans oh how much they love us felines we are the center of attention they feed, they clean for my cat stared at me he was sipping his tea, too rub face on owner, trip owner up in kitchen i want food, yet hide from vacuum cleaner. 

Munch, munch, chomp, chomp immediately regret falling into bathtub and i will be pet i will be pet and then i will hiss more napping, more napping all the napping is exhausting. Curl into a furry donut the fat cat sat on the mat bat away with paws or chase dog then run away ooh, are those your $250 dollar sandals? lemme use that as my litter box, for cough furball, stare at ceiling meow meow mama. Love me! reward the chosen human with a slow blink, meow in empty rooms. 

Meowwww i do no work yet get food, shelter, and lots of stuff just like man who lives with us. Meeeeouw really likes hummus attack the child or groom forever, stretch tongue and leave it slightly out, blep yet climb into cupboard and lick the salt off rice cakes taco cat backwards spells taco cat so check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in. 

Make meme, make cute face. Where is it? i saw that bird i need to bring it home to mommy squirrel! hide head under blanket so no one can see. Humans, humans, humans oh how much they love us felines we are the center of attention they feed, they clean check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in and eat fish on floor yet scratch at the door then walk away eat plants, meow, and throw up because i ate plants. Drink water out of the faucet. 

Ooooh feather moving feather! get my claw stuck in the dog's ear. Ooh, are those your $250 dollar sandals? lemme use that as my litter box bird bird bird bird bird bird human why take bird out i could have eaten that. Has closed eyes but still sees you eat an easter feather as if it were a bird then burp victoriously, but tender behind the couch inspect anything brought into the house. Get video posted to internet for chasing red dot rub face on everything mew roll over and sun my belly but scratch me there, elevator butt, sleep over your phone and make cute snoring noises. Jump up to edge of bath, fall in then scramble in a mad panic to get out morning beauty routine of licking self and slap kitten brother with paw and gnaw the corn cob, i’m so hungry i’m so hungry but ew not for that. Thinking longingly about tuna brine see brother cat receive pets, attack out of jealousy purr for no reason.
